Hi, I'm Blaise Ezeokeke. I am super interested in software development and Data Science. 
Currently, I am exploring courses on and practising with Frontend products. I will come to Data Science later.
Although, I have attended a Bootcamp for Fullstack development, hence some of the Backend projects in my portfolio.

I'm looking to collaborate in great Javascript and Frontend Projects.
